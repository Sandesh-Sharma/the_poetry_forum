      Hey Good Lookin'
      Whatchu got cookin'?
      


      What are heavy? Sea-sand and sorrow;
      What are brief? Today and tomorrow;
      What are frail? Spring blossoms and youth;
      What are deep? The ocean and truth.

       I am with you all guys
      because i am highfi
      don't worry about all
      that's not your foul
      
      

   # The man in a car 
   
   I once knew a man who lived in a car.
   For a stranger sight you'd have to go far.
   I asked him once why he lived in a car.
   He grimaced and said, how bizarre you are.


     like a bookmark, I accompany the your voice
     I felt solitude of conversation all over the night
     you are blessed one to born with only one choice
     As passed thousand years, it feels as if we've just met in evening light

      # Do not expect to hear a love story from me,
       The moon will come to hear story of another moon from me.

       # I wish we had an evening like this..
       Get out on a moon panel and come on roof.
       
       Roaming in the sky
       lonely as a cloud
       For those all your works 
       I am feeling really proud
    
      
       
       
       East or west 
       Imagination is best
       
       Goodbye, my love

        Say good night
        I cry every night
        I thought about it every single day
        don't mourn for me

        For I may never find you
        For you may never find me
        It is how it is Dear!!
        Will it be over Ever?
        Hey, my sunshine
        Let's dine and wine
        We'll be fine
        Under a vine
        And beyond ninety nine!!
        

        hello bro how are you?
        i am fine how do you do?
        i am missing you so much
        i am eating food so much
        
         
        I have a little cat
        his name is pat
        he sleeps on the mat
        he caught a big rat
	but of nowhere appeared a gnat

        ## "if i had only wish
        then i know what that would be
        i'd wish that how i feel
        for you is how you'd feel for me." ##
        

        There is something on me
        and i am asking for the ghee
        and thats again me
        
        I came here after 14 days, 
        to complete my hacktoberfest challange.
        Looking to the Repo,
        My laptop is my bebo.
        


        Humans are defined by their tragedy
        Money, resource and assets are the forecoming reality
        Why shouldn't we be curious???
        When the brain itself is eager to interprete its anatomy
        What shall define us
        Our humanity, mentality, spirituality or financial capacity,
        Our insanity can't withstand the duality
        Why shouldn't we be curious
        When love itself reveals the brutality?

	      ## Thought 
	      The challenge of thought finds
	      ourselves in constant 
	      questioning of our own beliefs
	      
	      #The river flows 
	      One goes deep into the flow 
	      Becomes busy flowing to it
	      Lost in the flow
	      what happns
	      Is that the one forgets
	      what he is flowing for


  Keeping Things Whole
      In a field
      I am the absence
      of the field
      This is
      always the case.
      Wherever I am
      I am what is missing.
      
      When I walk
      I part the air
      and always
      the air moves in
      to fill the spaces
      where my bodys been.


	
	      Its not cool to go school
	      But, School is not that cruel
	      We must go to make our life
	      Ok this much that I will type.


	      
	      
	      Rose is Red
              Voilet is Blue
	      Python, My Bae
	      I love you 
	      XD




         I'm about to lose my mind,
         you've been gone for soo long.


	      From east to west 
	      Python is The Best

	      
	       Roses are Red
	       Sky is blue
	       Hacktoberfest, I love you

        Making us numb I know how it feels
	      the time passes as I go deep 
	      in this constant battle of my beliefs

Worms are skinny,
Worms are fat,
They live in the ground,
They live in the cat.
Some can swim;
None can fly.
Chop them in half
And they multiply.


	
      	Name a single man who had no pain
	      Its life principle No pain No gain
	      You wanna gain then stand on your legs
	      Stop seeking for plead
	      Set your goal and make effort to have a step
	      Change the gravel into paved
	      So that your trash life will be saved



	


	If life is precious
	then why aren't we helping each other??
	why we are becoming more and more selfish?
	why why why?
